# NewGRF Extractor

![Example.](/_readme/overview.png)

This simple program allows the user to browse through his/her saved **NewGRF presets** and with one click **copy all** of those **NewGRFs** into a selected folder.



#### Typical use case:
A savegame with tens of NewGRFs, half of which are not on Bananas, of which half are "personalized" or not available for download anymore.

You might want to archive this game (to come back to it in the future), maybe give it to a friend (if you have one), or perhaps you want to alternate between a PC and an Android device (nothing better than starting a game at home on a PC and resuming it later on your phone on a train).

In all those scenarios you would have to manually search for and copy the needed files, one by one.

Now you can use this software to do it in seconds.

## Manual

1. Unpack the ZIP archive.
2. 'NewGRF_Extractor.exe' needs to be in the OpenTTD user files folder, right next to 'openttd.cfg'.
   (If you're on Windows, itâ€™s likely _C:\Users\your_username\Documents\OpenTTD_)
3. Run the app. The first thing you see should be a list of your presets.

4. When you click on a preset, its NewGRFs will be displayed.
5. To choose the destination directory, use the button "Copy NewGRFs to...".

6. After that, the program goes through _OpenTTD\newgrf_ and _OpenTTD\content_download\newgrf_ (+ their subfolders) and makes a copy of all found matching NewGRFs into a folder selected by the user.
